## ü§ó Hey there!

My name is Thiago Prado, a truly persistent and insistent front-end and mobile developer üòÅ. I say this because I've fought hard to achieve my dream of working in software development, and I continue to fight with every new bug or commit!
I'm currently a junior front-end and mobile developer at Entrega+.

I've been passionate about technology since I was 9 years old, when I first encountered a Microsoft desktop with Windows XP. I'm a Systems Development Technician and am currently pursuing my degree as a Systems Analyst.

## ‚ö°Expertise

I've been pursuing a specialization in Front-end and Mobile because it's what makes me happy, makes me want to be better, learn more, and have a successful career. I started out as a Java developer in college, where I learned all the logic, practices, and how to create organized and structured software. However, my first professional opportunity came as a web developer, creating all kinds of websites. A year ago, I discovered how to combine all my knowledge to develop mobile applications, and that's what has driven me so far.

I'm always looking to learn more, and I'm even working on becoming fluent in English, hopefully.

My hobbies include video games and board games, watching TV shows, reading, and getting plenty of sleep üòÖ... and coffee, of course.
